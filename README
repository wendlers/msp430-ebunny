Introduction
------------

This is just a quick little Easter hack. My wife brought in two cute little glass Easter bunnies lately, and the really demanded for a mod  . Well then. The bunnies got a blue LED implanted each, the LEDs where connected to a MSP430G2231 MCU, and the MCU is driven by a small firmware which pulses the LEDs through a PWM. 

Hardware Setup
--------------

See schamatics under doc/schematics

Compilation
------------

This project is written for msp430-gcc on Linux (I used v4.5.3 which is available as package on ubuntu). For flashing the "mspdebug" tool was used (also from the Ubuntu package).

To compile the source just issue a:

make -C src

This builds the firmware in the "src" subdirectory.


Flashing
------------

To flash the firmware, place the MCU in your Launchpad and use the “flash” make target:

make -C src flash

Usage
------------

As soon as the MCU is powered, the bunnies start glowing in paralell. Press the button to make them glow alternate. If the button is pressed again, the bunnies start glowing in paralell again.
